# TuneOS Repository

This is the official **APT repository** for TuneOS. For the **ISO build files and tooling**, see the [tuneos-build repository](https://github.com/mtbike80/tuneos-build).

TuneOS is a Debian-based distribution tailored for audio production and general, everday use for tech-savvy people. It's built on the premise that this will appeal to those who are musical, and would enjoy expressiving their creativity on an OS that is also easy and robust enough to use exclusively.

TuneOS 1 "Skipjack" is a work-in-progress. The targeted completime timeframe is the end of 2025.
